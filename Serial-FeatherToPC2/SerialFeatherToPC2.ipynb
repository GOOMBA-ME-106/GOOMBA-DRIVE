    "It may or not be obvious, but you can send data from your Feather hardware kit that a Python program running on your PC can read.  If you think about it, this almost _has_ to be possible, because the strings inside of ```print()``` statements in CircuitPython (CP) running on your Feather gets printed out the Serial window of Mu running on the PC.  So, clearly there's a way to get that data back to the PC.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not the only way to send data from the Feather to the PC, but it's probably the easiest to relate to and understand.  Some alternatives are to use some sort of (usually) non-human-readable binary protocol, or a different protocol (over USB or not) than a virtual serial communications port.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The downside\n",
    "\n",
    "The connection used for ```print()```-ing is exactly the one that you can use to communicate your data from the Feather to the PC.  The problem is that only one program can read this data from the Feather, and Mu grabs it if you are using the Serial window.  So, as long as you don't use Mu's Serial feature, some other program can grab this output just fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually what happens is when one program is trying to use that data stream, the other one will fail if it tries to grab it also, and give you some type of error that it's busy.  Fortunely it's very clear when this happens, rather than something weirder happening -- like just silently not receiving data.  Once one program closes its connection, another program can then open it.  So even if the Serial window _is_ open, just close it and re-start your data capturing program on the PC-side, and you'll be fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another solution which requires an additional ($5-20), special USB cable that connects directly from the Feather back to the PC.  The newer (v1.1) EduShields TriplerBaseboard has a place to (more easily) connect this cable, but I haven't even tested that part of the baseboard yet to it's unclear if the connector wiring works.  I ordered a few of these from two different vendors in China at the beginning of the year, but none of them ever got here and I'm still trying to get refunds for some of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, just to be clear -- this is *not* to say that you cannot use Mu at all -- you just can't use the Serial window feature.  You can continue to use it to edit your program, save new versions, etc.  Again, just don't use Serial if you're going to have your own program capture this data instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other significant downside of using they way of exchanging data is that it is a bit rate-limited.  It's probably limited to just a couple of megabits per second.  Having to convert binary data into strings and back out again probably doesn't help performance either."

    "## Installing software to allow USB data capture from the PC\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture this data on the PC side, you need a program that opens up a communications connection over USB to the kit to capture this printed-out data.  Assuming that you're going to be writing your own, you first need to install a library called \"pyserial\" into your Python environment.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

Assuming that you have an internet connection you should get some messages that lead you to believe that it was installed successfully.  Sometimes it tells you that ```conda``` is out-of-date, and you can run the suggested command after this is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than Anaconda/JupyterLab, if you're going to use Mu to run this on the PC in Python3 Mode, I don't think that you have to install anything, because I think that Mu may have already done this for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "However you're running Python3, you just need to be able to just run the ```import serial``` without an error, and you're ready."

    "## General strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "So far you've learned two ways to get data into your program from the outside world -- ```input()``` from the keyboard, and reading data from a file (```open(), read()/readline(), close()```).  Both are kind-of similar -- each eventually yields a string, or something (bytes) that can be turned into one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting data from your Feather board over the \"serial port\" is a third way.  Not terribly different from the two that you already know, but not substantially more difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to opening a file, you have to be able to state what (file) it is that you want to connect to (that is, to \"open\").  Windows and MacOS have different ways of naming this connection resource.  On MacOS, it's just a specially named file.  On Windows it's called a \"COM port\".  There's no reason why you wouldn't be able to connect multiple Feather boards to your PC, but you need to understand how to refer to each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "My recommendation is to write the program on the PC side and initially use ```input()``` to get the data, then do whatever needs to be done.  Once that's working you just change the PC side (ideally you just change one line of code, if you do it intelligently) to call the other input function, and then run the CP program to replace the human.  Then you're pretty much done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that while you lose the ability to use ```print()``` statements in the CP program for debugging, there's no such limitation on the PCs-side, because there's no program capturing its output.  So it still easy to debug/trace what's going on on the PC-side as normal."

    "There's a fancier way of finding out this thing's name by using some additional functions in the _pyserial_ library, but we're going to do it the more straight-forward way, which also shows you how your PC's OS deals with external hardware more generally.\n",
    "\n",
    "On MacOS, for every USB device that's connected, a file is automagically created in your ```/dev``` directory that gives programs access to that device.  It's usually called ```/dev/tty.usbmodem<BLAH>```.  You can either use your Finder to find it, or you can open a Terminal window and enter ```ls -l /dev/tty.usbmodem*```, and it'll tell you.  Hopefully there will only be one of these on your system, so it won't be ambiguous.  This is the (device) file that you need to open to get to your kit.\n",
